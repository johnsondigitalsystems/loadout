// FILE: lib/screens/range_day/scope_training_models.dart
//
// ============================================================================
// WHAT THIS FILE DOES
// ============================================================================
// Pure data + math helpers for the Scope View "Training mode" panel
// (see `scope_view_screen.dart` — features 1–4 in the spec). Lives in
// its own file so the math is unit-testable without dragging in the
// full-screen widget hierarchy.
//
// ============================================================================
// PRO-GATING CONTRACT
// ============================================================================
// The model side of training mode is intentionally Pro-agnostic — pure
// math has no business looking at `EntitlementNotifier`. The UI panel
// in `scope_view_screen.dart` is responsible for gating these
// affordances; the same is true for the moving-target card in
// `range_day_detail_screen.dart` (already wrapped in
// `ProGate(feature: 'Moving target lead', ...)`).
//
// Pro-gated training affordances (when the panel UI lands):
//   * AimMode.free toggle — auto-aim stays free (it's the default).
//   * SkillLevel dropdown — beginner/intermediate/advanced/expert.
//   * TrainingOverlays.predictedImpact — only meaningful in free-aim
//     mode, so gating that mode covers it.
//   * TrainingOverlays.probabilityEllipse — same.
//   * TrainingOverlays.animation — animated-target playback.
//   * TrainingOverlays.ambushGuides — leading-edge/center-mass hash
//     highlights.
//
// The convenience getter `TrainingOverlays.requiresPro` says whether a
// given overlay configuration is Pro-only. If a panel needs to inspect
// that, prefer the getter so the gating policy stays in one place.
//
// What's in here:
//
//   * `enum AimMode` — auto-aim vs free-aim toggle state.
//   * `enum SkillLevel` — beginner / intermediate / advanced / expert.
//     Drives the timing-window tolerances on a moving-target stage.
//   * `class TrainingOverlays` — bag of bool flags (predicted impact /
//     probability ellipse / ambush guides / target animation).
//     Round-trips to/from JSON for persistence on `RangeDaySessions`.
//   * `class ShootingWindow` — earliest / optimal / latest time offsets
//     in milliseconds plus a hit-likelihood at the current offset.
//   * `class PredictedImpact` — predicted (xMil, yMil) impact location
//     for a given aim point in mil-from-FOV-center coords.
//   * `class TargetAmbushPoints` — leading-edge ambush + center-mass
//     ambush hold-off in mils, given a moving target.
//   * `computeShootingWindow(...)`, `computePredictedImpact(...)`,
//     `computeAmbushPoints(...)` — the three pure functions the screen
//     calls.
//
// ============================================================================
// SKILL-LEVEL TIMING WINDOW MATH
// ============================================================================
// For a moving-target stage the user has a finite time window during
// which the bullet-flight time matches the lead from where the target
// will be. The optimal shot fires the bullet so it arrives when the
// target is at the aim point. Earlier shots over-lead; later shots
// under-lead. The skill window is symmetric around the optimal point:
//
//   * Beginner:     ±220 ms — a forgiving window for new shooters.
//   * Intermediate: ±120 ms — a typical local-match cadence.
//   * Advanced:     ±60 ms  — competition pace.
//   * Expert:       ±25 ms  — championship pace.
//
// Hit likelihood at a time offset Δt from optimal is computed by
// shifting the target's position by `(targetSpeed × Δt)` and integrating
// the user's 2D Gaussian dispersion ellipse over the target shape at
// the new position. We reuse the same closed-form erf-based
// approximation [scope_view_screen.dart] uses for its live "what-if"
// ring (avoids spinning up the heavy Monte Carlo HitProbabilityService
// for every drag tick).
//
// ============================================================================
// PREDICTED IMPACT (FREE-AIM MODE)
// ============================================================================
// In free-aim mode the user drags the reticle anywhere in the FOV. The
// predicted impact = aim - (drop+wind solution offset) - dispersion mean
// - target lead (already baked into the solution drop/wind via the
// parent screen's solver call). We don't re-run the solver here; the
// parent passes pre-computed dropMil + windMil that already encode the
// firing solution. The "mean dispersion offset" is zero for an unbiased
// shooter and tiny for a real one — we ignore it for v1 (the spec calls
// out a future per-rifle zero-offset, which we leave hooked but unused).
