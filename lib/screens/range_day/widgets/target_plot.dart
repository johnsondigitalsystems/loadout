// WHAT THIS FILE DOES
// ============================================================================
// Visual target widget for the Range Day workspace. Renders the chosen
// target (paper / steel / silhouette) inside a box, with each recorded
// `ShotImpactRow` drawn as a small dot at the stored normalized
// (-1..1, -1..1) position.
//
// Two tap modes (selected by the parent via [tapMode]):
//
//   * `TargetPlotTapMode.aimPoint` — taps move the aim marker via
//     [onAimPointSet]. The marker renders as a small crosshair at the
//     normalized (-1..1, -1..1) location stored on the session row.
//   * `TargetPlotTapMode.recordShot` — taps register a new impact via
//     [onTapAt] (existing behaviour).
//
// Two view modes (selected by the parent via [viewMode]):
//
//   * `TargetPlotViewMode.targetFocused` (default) — the target fills the
//     widget box at its true aspect ratio. Best for accurate dot
//     placement: maximum tap area, easiest to long-press a specific
//     impact, easiest to read distance between hits.
//   * `TargetPlotViewMode.realistic` — composes a daytime range scene
//     (sky + grass + dirt mound for singles, sky + grass for racks),
//     places the target on a pole or hangs rack children from chains,
//     and overlays a circular scope reticle on top. Approximates "what
//     you actually see through a scope at the range".
//
// In both modes a tap inside the target area still maps to the same
// normalized (-1..1, -1..1) coordinates so the parent's `onTapAt` /
// `onAimPointSet` callbacks behave identically and previously-recorded
// shots / aim points stay positionally consistent across mode switches.
//
// When a [reticle] is provided in `targetFocused` mode, the renderer
// paints a [ReticleRenderer] overlay anchored on the aim marker (or
// target center if no aim point is set). In `realistic` mode the
// reticle is drawn natively by the painter chain inside the scope ring
// — the [reticle] parameter is accepted but ignored in favour of the
// dedicated precision-mil reticle that matches the reference look.
//
// Rack vs single dispatch (realistic mode):
//
//   * Single target — pole rises from a soft dirt mound; target stands
//     on top.
//   * Rack target ([rackChildren] non-null) — ground furniture varies
//     by the active rack's [rackMountStyle] (§6A.3 of the v2.3
//     brief):
//       - `hanging_rail`     : horizontal cross-bar across the top
//                              of the rack, each child hangs from a
//                              short dashed chain (legacy v2.3
//                              behaviour, also the fallback for
//                              unknown / null mount style).
//       - `standing_stakes`  : one thin wood-brown stake under each
//                              child, running from the child's
//                              bottom into the foreground mound.
//       - `popper_base`      : concrete-grey trapezoidal base under
//                              each child sitting on the grass line.
//                              Shared mound suppressed (the per-
//                              child bases ARE the ground furniture).
//       - `individual_posts` : per-child wooden post + small earth-
//                              berm oval. Shared mound suppressed.
//     The active child (by [activeRackChildIndex]) is rendered at
//     full opacity with a thicker outline ([kRackActiveStrokeWidth])
//     and gets the aim-point + shot-dots overlay; the others render
//     at 70% opacity with [kRackInactiveStrokeWidth].
//
// ============================================================================
// WHY IT EXISTS IN THE ARCHITECTURE
// ============================================================================
// Range Day's interactive target surface lives here so the parent
// screen (`range_day_detail_screen.dart`) can stay focused on session
// state + ballistic math. The widget is intentionally stateless —
// every interaction bubbles up through the callback parameters and the
// parent owns the database side.
//
// Realistic mode is intentionally separate from target-focused mode at
// the painter level. They share the (-1..1, -1..1) coordinate contract
// but the visual chains diverge: target-focused mode renders one shape
// onto a flat background, realistic mode composes a full daytime scene
// behind a circular scope. Mixing both into a single painter would
// either bloat its responsibilities or leak realistic-mode concepts
// (sky / grass / scope ring) into the simpler default path.
//
// ============================================================================
// WHY THIS IS HARDER THAN IT LOOKS
// ============================================================================
//   * Normalized coordinates (-1..1, -1..1) are the wire format for
//     persisted shots and aim points. Both view modes share the same
//     coordinate space — the painter / hit-test math just changes the
//     pixel rectangle the (-1..1, -1..1) box occupies. Switching modes
//     never re-normalizes the stored impact rows.
//   * The Y axis is flipped at the screen boundary so +1 = top (matches
//     the shooter's mental model). Don't move that flip out of the
//     widget — every persisted shot in the DB assumes this convention.
//   * Realistic mode composes ScopeDaytimeBackdropPainter (with target
//     silhouette disabled) so the painter chain stays on a single
//     `CustomPaint`. We can't drop the `ScopeDaytimeBackdrop` widget
//     into a Stack here because we want the backdrop, the pole/chains,
//     and the target silhouettes to share one repaint pass + one
//     repaint boundary — keeping the painter call cheap on the hot
//     path.
//   * In rack mode, the (-1..1, -1..1) box is anchored on the *active
//     child*, not the whole rack. Tap math measures from the active
//     child's bounding box so the persisted shot coordinates remain
//     comparable across child switches.
//   * Default aim-point fallback: when both `aimPointX` and `aimPointY`
//     are null, the realistic-mode reticle is drawn at the active
//     target's geometric center (normalized 0, 0) so first-time users
//     see a reticle squarely on the target instead of floating on the
//     scope edge. The target-focused reticle keeps the same fallback
//     for consistency.
//
// ============================================================================
// WHO CONSUMES THIS FILE
// ============================================================================
//   * lib/screens/range_day/range_day_detail_screen.dart — the only
//     consumer today. The parent passes `rackChildren` +
//     `activeRackChildIndex` whenever a rack target is active so the
//     realistic painter knows to render chains instead of a pole.
//
// ============================================================================
// SIDE EFFECTS
// ============================================================================
// None — purely visual. The parent owns persistence and any database
// I/O triggered by the callbacks.
