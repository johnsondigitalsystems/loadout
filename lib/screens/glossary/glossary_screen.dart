// FILE: lib/screens/glossary/glossary_screen.dart
//
// ============================================================================
// WHAT THIS FILE DOES
// ============================================================================
// Renders the in-app reloading glossary: a searchable, alphabetized list
// of terms grouped by topic (cartridge anatomy, ballistics, powder, etc.).
// Reachable from the side drawer entry "Glossary" and from the in-form
// `GlossaryLabel` widget's "Open in Glossary" button (pre-filtered via
// the `initialQuery` constructor parameter).
//
// All content is held in the public `const List<GlossaryTerm>
// kGlossaryTerms = [...]` at the top of the file. Each `GlossaryTerm`
// carries a term, an optional acronym, a category, a definition, an
// optional 1–3 sentence worked `example`, and an optional
// `exampleNumbers` chip with concrete values. `GlossaryTerm.matches(query)`
// does case-insensitive substring search across ALL FIVE text fields,
// so a user searching for a phrase from a worked example finds the
// right entry. The class and table are public so
// `lib/services/glossary_lookup.dart` and `lib/widgets/glossary_label.dart`
// can read them without duplicating data.
//
// The category tags (`_catCartridge`, `_catBallistics`, `_catRangeDay`,
// `_catOptics`, `_catLoadDev`, `_catPowder`, `_catPrimers`, `_catBrass`,
// `_catProcess`, `_catFirearm`) are defined as `const String`s so they
// appear by reference in every term and have one canonical spelling.
// The `_categoryOrder` list locks display order across the screen.
//
// `GlossaryScreen` is a `StatefulWidget` with two pieces of state:
//
//   - `_searchController` — drives the search text field. Pre-seeded
//     from `widget.initialQuery` if the caller passed one.
//   - `_query` — the current trimmed query string
//
// Rebuilds on every keystroke. `_filterAndGroup()` filters
// `kGlossaryTerms` by matching against `_query`, groups the survivors
// into a `Map<category, List<GlossaryTerm>>`, sorts terms alphabetically
// inside each group, and returns the map.
//
// The body renders the search field at the top (with a clear-button
// suffix when non-empty), an optional match-count line ("12 matches"),
// and either an empty-state placeholder or a list of `_CategorySection`
// cards. Each section card has a tinted header (category name + count)
// and a list of `_GlossaryTermTile` rows.
//
// Each `_GlossaryTermTile` always shows the term, optional acronym,
// and definition. If the term carries a worked `example`, a chevron
// at the right edge signals the row is tappable; tapping reveals an
// "Example" panel below the definition with the example text and (if
// present) a small numeric chip from `exampleNumbers`. Entries WITHOUT
// an `example` don't render the chevron and don't respond to taps —
// there's nothing to reveal. When the user is actively searching, the
// matching tiles auto-expand the example panel via
// `initiallyExpanded: true` so example-text matches are immediately
// visible.
//
// ============================================================================
// WHY IT EXISTS IN THE ARCHITECTURE
// ============================================================================
// Reloading has a dense vocabulary (CBTO, headspace, shoulder bump,
// freebore, BC G1 vs G7, MOA vs Mil, etc.) and the rest of the app
// uses these terms freely in field labels and tooltips. The glossary
// is the in-app safety net for users who haven't memorized every piece
// of jargon — they can swipe out the side drawer, search for a term,
// and read a plain-English definition without leaving the app. The
// worked `example` field on the most-confused terms takes the user
// the next step: from "I know what density altitude IS" to "I see
// what 8400 ft DA looks like in the ballistics solver."
//
// Several other screens in the codebase use this file as a layout
// pattern reference for the search-then-grouped-cards UX: a top
// `TextField`, a count-of-matches line, and `Card`-wrapped sections
// with a tinted header. If you're building a similar screen, this is
// the canonical template.
//
// ============================================================================
// WHY THIS IS HARDER THAN IT LOOKS
// ============================================================================
// Three mildly subtle things:
//
//   1. The `_GlossaryTermTile` is keyed by the search-mode default in
//      its parent `_CategorySection` so search-state transitions force
//      a fresh widget identity (and therefore a fresh `_expanded`
//      initialization in `initState`). Without this, a tile that the
//      user manually expanded would lose its expanded state on the
//      next search-state transition; with it, search re-mounts the
//      tile with the appropriate default.
//   2. Tapping a tile is a no-op when `term.example == null` — the
//      `InkWell.onTap` is set to `null` (not just an empty closure)
//      so the row doesn't ripple, and the chevron is omitted entirely.
//      Mixing entries with and without examples in the same list is
//      intentional: not every term needs a worked example.
//   3. The "no matches" empty-state and the search-clear button both
//      need to gracefully handle the user mid-typing. Trimming the
//      query (`value.trim()`) keeps a leading-space keystroke from
//      collapsing the entire result set.
//
// Otherwise this is a straightforward filter-and-render screen.
//

// WHO CONSUMES THIS FILE
// ============================================================================
// - `lib/screens/home/home_screen.dart` — the side drawer's "Glossary"
//   entry pushes this screen.
// - `lib/screens/how_it_works/how_it_works_screen.dart` — the
//   "Glossary" topic CTA pushes this screen.
// - `lib/widgets/glossary_label.dart` — the in-form "Open in Glossary"
//   button pushes this screen with `initialQuery` set so it lands
//   pre-filtered on the term the user tapped.
// - `lib/services/glossary_lookup.dart` — reads `kGlossaryTerms` to
//   resolve a label string to a definition without rendering the
//   screen.
//
// ============================================================================
// SIDE EFFECTS
// ============================================================================
// None — pure rendering of compile-time `const` data. No I/O, no
// network, no plugin calls.
