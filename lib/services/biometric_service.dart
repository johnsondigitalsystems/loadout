// WHAT THIS FILE DOES
// ============================================================================
// Wraps the platform's local biometric authentication (Face ID / Touch
// ID on iOS, fingerprint on Android, Windows Hello on desktop) and
// surfaces it to the LoadOut UI as a small reactive service.
//
// Biometric in LoadOut is a **local unlock gate**, not a sign-in
// method. Firebase Auth already keeps the user signed in across app
// launches via a refresh token cached in the platform's secure
// storage; once a user successfully signs in with email/password,
// Google, Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo, anonymous, or an email link,
// Firebase replays that session on every subsequent launch. Enabling
// biometric simply layers a "you must prove this is you" prompt
// between the Firebase-cached session and the HomeScreen.
//
// This means:
//   * Biometric is ALWAYS connected to whichever Firebase account the
//     user last signed in with — no separate enrolment, no password
//     re-entry. The same Face ID that unlocks the user's iPhone is
//     enough to unlock LoadOut against their existing account.
//   * Biometric never reads, stores, or transmits any account
//     credential. The unlock decision is purely "is the OS happy
//     this is the device's primary user?"; on success we flip a
//     single in-memory bit and let the rest of the app proceed.
//   * Disabling biometric is non-destructive: the user still has
//     their Firebase session, they just stop seeing the unlock prompt.
//
// Public API:
//   * `bool get isAvailable` — true once `_probe()` has confirmed the
//     OS exposes biometric AND the user has at least one biometric
//     enrolled.
//   * `bool get isEnabled` — has the user opted into "use biometric
//     to unlock LoadOut?" Persisted via SharedPreferences.
//   * `bool get isUnlocked` — transient; true once biometric has
//     succeeded this app session, OR true permanently when [isEnabled]
//     is false (no gate to clear).
//   * `Future<void> setEnabled(bool)` — flip the persisted preference.
//     Enabling immediately requires a biometric pass to confirm the
//     user actually has biometric working; we don't trust a "yes"
//     toggle without a follow-up auth.
//   * `Future<bool> authenticate({required String reason})` — one-
//     shot prompt; returns true on success, false on cancellation /
//     failure / timeout. On success, flips [isUnlocked] to true and
//     notifies listeners.
//   * `void lock()` — testing / sign-out hook to re-arm the gate.
//
// ============================================================================
// WHY IT EXISTS IN THE ARCHITECTURE
// ============================================================================
// `_AuthGate` in `lib/app.dart` watches the Firebase auth stream and
// chooses between [LoginScreen] and [HomeScreen]. Biometric inserts
// a third state — "user is signed in but the app is locked behind
// biometric" — which the gate renders as a [BiometricLockScreen]
// instead of [HomeScreen] when this service reports `isEnabled &&
// !isUnlocked`.
//
// Splitting biometric into its own service (rather than wiring it
// directly into `_AuthGate`) keeps the gate's logic small and lets
// the Settings → Account screen and any future "lock on background"
// feature share the same source of truth.
//
// ============================================================================
// WHY THIS IS HARDER THAN IT LOOKS
// ============================================================================
//   * **Availability is a two-condition check.** `local_auth` can
//     report "device supports biometric" while the user has never
//     enrolled a face or fingerprint. Both conditions must be true
//     for the toggle to be functional, so [_probe] reads
//     `isDeviceSupported` AND `getAvailableBiometrics().isNotEmpty`
//     before declaring availability.
//   * **The OS prompt is asynchronous AND user-cancellable.** Every
//     entry point that triggers `authenticate(...)` has to handle a
//     `false` return cleanly — either re-prompt, fall through to
//     sign-out, or leave the lock screen up. We never auto-retry on
//     failure; the user explicitly drives the next step.
//   * **`stickyAuth: true` matters.** Without it, the OS dismisses
//     the prompt the moment the app backgrounds (e.g., if the user
//     pulls down notification center). Sticky-auth keeps the prompt
//     alive across brief OS interruptions, which matches the
//     "unlock once per session" semantics.
//   * **Enable-with-confirm.** Toggling the preference to ON without
//     immediately running an auth would let a user enable a feature
//     they can't actually use (e.g., they tapped Yes on the OS
//     enrolment dialog but didn't finish). [setEnabled] runs an
//     auth as part of the enable path so we know the gate works
//     before we start enforcing it.
//
// ============================================================================
// WHO CONSUMES THIS FILE
// ============================================================================
// - lib/app.dart — provides the singleton; `_AuthGate` reads
//   `isEnabled && !isUnlocked` to decide whether to render the
//   biometric unlock screen.
// - lib/screens/settings/account_settings_screen.dart — exposes
//   the toggle and triggers [setEnabled].
// - lib/screens/auth/biometric_lock_screen.dart — the gate UI;
//   calls [authenticate] and [lock].
//
// ============================================================================
// SIDE EFFECTS
// ============================================================================
// - Reads / writes `SharedPreferences` under
//   `biometric_unlock_enabled`.
// - Triggers the platform biometric dialog on every
//   [authenticate] call (Face ID / Touch ID / fingerprint sheet,
//   on whichever platform).
