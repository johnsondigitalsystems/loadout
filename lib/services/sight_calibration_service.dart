// WHAT THIS FILE DOES
// ============================================================================
// Drop-Per-Click (DPC) sight calibration. Derives the firearm's true sight
// scale factor (vertical or horizontal) from observed shot impacts on a
// known-distance, known-dial test target.
//
// Many scopes don't track exactly to their advertised increments. A turret
// labeled "0.1 mil per click" might actually move 0.097 mil per click.
// Across a 50-click dial that's a 1.5-click error — at 1000 yards that's
// over a foot of impact-point error. Litz / Long Range Shooting (and
// Applied Ballistics) have a standard procedure to detect and correct
// this, called the "tall target test":
//
//   1. Hang a target with a vertical (or horizontal) reference line at a
//      known distance — typically 100 yards.
//   2. Aim at the bottom of the line, fire a fouling shot, then dial up a
//      known elevation amount (e.g. 10 mil up).
//   3. Fire 3-5 shots without changing aim. Their centroid is where the
//      scope ACTUALLY moved the bullet's point of impact.
//   4. Measure the centroid's vertical offset from the aim point.
//   5. Compute the *measured* mil-per-click = measured offset / commanded
//      dial in mil. The scale factor is measured / advertised.
//
// This service implements step 5 — given the impacts (in normalized
// target coords matching the rest of the Range Day workspace), the
// distance, and the commanded dial amount, derive the scale factor.
//
// Public API:
//
//   * `class SightCalibrationObservation` — one impact entry. Same shape
//     as `ShotImpactRow.impactX/impactY` (normalized to [-1, 1] across
//     the target). Calibration uses these directly.
//
//   * `class SightCalibrationResult` — derived ratio plus diagnostics
//     (centroid offset in mil, residuals from each impact, group RMS).
//
//   * `class SightCalibrationService` — stateless. One method,
//     `calibrate(...)`.
//
// ============================================================================
// THE MATH
// ============================================================================
// Convert each normalized impact coordinate to inches at the target:
//
//     impactInchesY = impactY * targetHeightIn / 2
//
// Compute the centroid of the impacts (mean of all observation y-values).
// The centroid is the unbiased estimator of the scope's actual "where it
// puts the impact" given the dial setting. We use the centroid rather
// than any single shot because individual impacts carry the rifle's
// intrinsic group dispersion (~0.5 MOA at 100 yd ≈ 0.5") plus shooter
// noise; the centroid drains out that noise as the sample size grows.
//
// Convert the centroid offset to angular mils at the target distance:
//
//     measuredMil = atan(centroidInches / (distanceYd × 36)) × 1000
//
// (rangeInches = yards × 36; tan(θ) ≈ θ in mil for small angles.)
//
// The advertised dial amount is what the user told us they dialed. The
// actual mil-per-click is measuredMil / clicks if we know the click count;
// equivalently the **scale factor** is:
//
//     scale = measuredMil / advertisedMil
//
// Where:
//   * scale = 1.0 → scope tracks perfectly.
//   * scale < 1.0 → scope undertracks (dialing up 10 mil moves impact
//     less than 10 mil; the user needs to dial MORE to hit the right
//     elevation).
//   * scale > 1.0 → scope overtracks (rare, but seen on cheap scopes).
//
// For the firearm row's `sightScaleVertical` / `sightScaleHorizontal`
// fields, we store `scale` as-is. The solver multiplies its commanded
// elevation by this factor when reporting the dial amount, so a user
// with a 0.97 scope sees holdover values 3% smaller — matching what
// they'll actually need to dial on the turret.
//
// ============================================================================
// HOW MANY SHOTS IS ENOUGH?
// ============================================================================
// The standard error of the centroid is σ_group / √n. With σ_group ≈ 0.3"
// at 100 yd and N=3 shots: SE = 0.17". At a 10 mil dial and 100 yd, that's
// a 0.005 scale uncertainty (0.5 % of the measured ratio). Five shots cuts
// it to 0.13" / 0.004 scale uncertainty — well below the variability of
// the scope's clicks themselves.
//
// We surface RMS group spread in the result so the UI can show the user
// "your group at the dial point was 0.4 MOA" — useful context for whether
// the calibration is good (tight group) or noisy (1.5 MOA, calibration
// suspect).
